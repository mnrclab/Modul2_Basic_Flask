    "### **What is Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes the process of designing a web application simpler. Flask lets us focus on what the users are **requesting and what sort of response to give back.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask (source code) is a Python web framework built with a small core and modularity in mind. With a small footprint, well documented and supported by a growing community, Flask can be a good choice to implement on top a nice production-ready apps, landing pages, complex eCommerce services and off course, admin dashboards."

    "### **What is HTTP and What Does it Have to do with Flask?**\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is the protocol for websites. The internet uses it to interact and communicate with computers and servers. Let me give you an example of how you use it everyday.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type the name of a website in the address bar of your browser and you hit enter. What happens is that an HTTP request has been sent to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when I go to my address bar and type google.com, then hit enter, an HTTP request is sent to a Google Server. The Google Server receives the request and needs to figure how to interpret that request. The Google Server sends back an HTTP response that contains the information that my web browser receives. Then it displays what you asked for on a page in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How is Flask involved?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will write code that will take care of the server side processing. Our code will receive requests. It will figure out what those requests are dealing with and what they are asking. It will also figure out what response to send to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do all this we will use Flask."

    "  We made two new changes\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Line 1**: We imported ``render_template()`` method from the flask framework. ``render_template()`` looks for a template (HTML file) in the templates folder. Then it will render the template for which you ask. Learn more about render_templates() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 7**: We change the return so that now it returns ``render_template(“home.html”)``. This will let us view our HTML file.\n",
